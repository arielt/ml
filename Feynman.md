Feynman Technique is a learning method attributed to Richard Feynman.

For the topic you want to understand:

## Step 1

Create a new page and write the topic in H1 (#) at the top.

## Step 2

Write down the explanation of the topic, as if you were teaching it to someone else. Pinpoint items that you don't know - ~~strike them through~~ with (~~)


## Step 3

Review items you've pinpointed in the previous step. Use books, white papers, any other material till you get to understand them and repeat step 2.

## Step 4

Revisit your page, for each wordy or confusing item, try to either simplify the language or create an analogy to understand it better.
