# Machine learning

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a study of intelligent agents, that can perceive it's environment and take actions to succeed at some goals.

Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence. It's goal is to enable machines to learn on their own, be able to discover patterns on observed data, create models, take actions and predict things without being explicitly programmed for that.

There are 2 main topics in Machine Learning: supervised and unsupervised learning.

## Supervised Learning

~~In supervised learning, training data sets are labeled with desired outcomes.
Model is trained on those data sets and applied later to the real world data.~~

### Overfitting
~~Model perfectly fits on training data sets but produces hardly explained results on real world data.~~
